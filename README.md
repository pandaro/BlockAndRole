Role play game for minetest

## Manifest

This is a role play game test for the Minetest engine, inspired by various classic RPG games. A special mention to [RPGTest](https://github.com/cdqwertz/rpgtest).

The game wants to be an implementation on the Minetest engine of the great classic role-playing games, among which I quote: Dungeons & Dragons, Sacred, Final Fantasy.

### Project Rules and Priorities

I have imposed rules that try to limit the work:

- **Precedence to game mechanics** for the moment, aesthetics will be postponed.
- **Formation of a work team**, otherwise the project will never end.
- **Some classic mods will not be present** in order not to weigh down the game. I am referring to trains, mounts, automations and everything that is not strictly necessary for the creation of a classic RPG.
- On the other hand, the following will be of **great importance**: experience, skills, races, quests, biomes, potions, spells, weapons, upgrades, armor, trade with NPC; fundamental "conditio sine qua non" is to achieve a powerful, fluid and immersive implementation of the entities and therefore the formation of a complete bestiary.
- **Limit globalstep as much as possible**, their implementation must be limited as much as possible, always to keep the best performance.

Please refer to this article to uniform our terms and name conventions: [Role-playing game terminology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game_terms)

### Team Formation and Management

- I firmly believe that the creation of an RPG requires a collective effort.
- The creation and management of a team capable of working harmoniously and in the less toxic way is a real job, which has the same importance, if not greater importance than the other tasks.
- We still don't know how many people will dedicate themselves to this project.
- How many are actually needed to complete it.
- I can assume some sector management that contributors will be able to assume, but they could coalesce or disintegrate depending on many factors.

#### Dev Sectors Example

- Formspec/inventory manager
- Texture manager
- Model manager
- Skills and experience manager
- Mapgen manager
- Server manager
- Potion and alchemy manager
- Spell manager
- Node/tool/item/craft manager
- Quest and dialogue manager
- Economy and trade manager
- Engine dev support (artillery)
- Game mechanics is a community management

**Note:**
- I have not listed all the possible sectors.
- Some sectors could be taken on by more than one person.
- Some people may take on multiple sectors.
- A manager does not bind to a single sector, but indicates who is the reference.
- The manager is played as long as you feel like it.
- Being the manager of one sector does not prevent you from expressing opinions or contributing in other sectors.
- Being the manager of a sector allows you to take part in the decision-making process on the project.
- Sector managers but also contributors who are not officially managers of a sector can take part in the decision-making process, provided they are actually involved in the development.

### About the Founder

- I am a founder, and like every foundation I care that the project is born, develops and comes to expression.
- Well aware that everything is born, grows and dies.
- I'm not an expert coder, although I have accumulated a number of hours in coding.
- I can't always be there as I have a real life.
- I don't want to deal with everything.
- I believe in communities.
- I love inputocracy.

I write this manifesto well aware that it could be a waste of time. I don't have the ambition that this project go through, simply because it doesn't depend only on me. I repeat, I can't do everything.
